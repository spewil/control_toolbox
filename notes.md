TODO
- prove that K is invariant to goal
    - just feed back the task error to reach a set point!
        - the cost want's the state, whatever it is, to go to zero.
    - K, S, etc is translation invariant to the goal state
    - to build this translation into the state/dynamics, we augment the state/cost with the target
        - this just computes the error from that state internally
    - write about this:
        - L is linear in state, we can apply linear operations to it?
        - S is quadratic in state, but we can also linearly transform it?
        - value functions and controllers are additive... but still linear/quadratic
- gain intuition about matrix operations
    - control law computation
    - backwards recursion
- multiple targets?
    - this doesn't work by adding another target, doesn't converge
    - does this make sense? would need to decide between targets?
        - can't optimize for two errors simultaneously?
- make time, force, etc into reasonable units for interpretability

Goals
